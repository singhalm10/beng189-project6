# Modeling Hodgkin-Huxley Dynamics with Cell-Specific Context 

BENG 189, Spring 2022

Group 6: Benjamin Hofflich, Meenakshi Singhal, Isabella Wolf

Motivated by the need to represent the diversity of neural populations within the brain, we explored the potential of extending the Hodgkin-Huxley model through the addition of new channel parameters.

In particular, we look at regularly spiking (RS) and intrinsically bursting (IB) Traub neurons, which both have implications in healthy and diseased neural states.
